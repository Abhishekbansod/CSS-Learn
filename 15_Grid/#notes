CSS Grid Layout 
Grid is basically used for creating the diff diff layouts of web page
just like table, position and flex box we can use Grid for creating layouts.

Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows. However, many more layouts are either possible or easier with CSS grid than they were with tables. For example, a grid container's child elements could position themselves so they actually overlap and layer, similar to CSS positioned elements.
